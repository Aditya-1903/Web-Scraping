# Web-Scraping

Web scraping is a term used to describe the use of a program or algorithm to extract and process large amounts of data from the web.
The Internet hosts perhaps the greatest source of information—and misinformation—on the planet. 
Many disciplines, such as data science, business intelligence, and investigative reporting, can benefit enormously from collecting and analyzing data from websites.

In this project, we have decided to scrape data from an e-commerce website. The main motive of scraping an e-commerce website is Product Comparison. Using their HTML tags, products can be compared for their prices, specifications, ratings and reviews. 
Since this data is mainly unstructured, using a web scraping tool will be very helpful to get this data in an organised manner. 
This makes our job much simpler and easier!
